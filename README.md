Hi!

I am using this repository to learn and track my progress on understanding of neural network and designing them.
Here I learn to make a neural network from scratch by first making the building blocks of forward and backward propagation, desgining a function to see the forward and backward pass using nice looking graphs :D, and then finally designing and using a neural network to minimize the loss fucntion using simple gradient descent for a binary classification problem.

Finally completed. Now I will learn pytorch and see how I can relate the concepts I learned here to pytorch. And then do real projects to solidify my understanding, yey.
More to come!

I am following Andrej Karpathy's youtube channel for learning. He is awesome ^_^
